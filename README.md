ðŸš€ Express.js Journey â€“ From Start to Finish

Welcome to my Express.js journey, where Iâ€™ve documented everything from the basics to advanced-level implementations. This repository is a reflection of my learning curve, challenges, and hands-on experience with Express.js â€“ the fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

What's Inside:

Setting up a basic Express server

Route handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Middleware integration

RESTful API development

Authentication & Authorization

Error handling & Logging

MVC architecture

Connecting to MongoDB

Environment variable management

Deployment-ready setup.
